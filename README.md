# Semantic Segmentation using a Fully Convolutional Neural Network

### Introduction
This repository contains a set of python scripts for you to train and test semantic segmentation using a fully convolutional neural network. Our semantic segmentation network is based on the [paper](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jonlong/long_shelhamer_fcn.pdf) described by Jonathan Long et al.
